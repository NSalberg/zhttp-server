# Zig HTTP Server (Learning Project)

**ðŸš§ Work In Progress / Not Production Ready ðŸš§**

This is a small HTTP server written in [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) as a learning exercise. I'm trying to wrap my head around Zig's syntax, standard library, and how to handle network I/O. Donâ€™t expect any best practices here, it's just me learning as I go.

## What You'll Find (Painful, Possibly Broken, and Totally Imperfect)

- **Crude request parsing**: Likely fragile and full of hacks.
- **No graceful error handling**: Expect random crashes or weird behavior under edge-case scenarios.
- **Embarrassing code**: Inconsistent naming, weird structure, half-baked ideas, and questionable patterns.

## Why Should You Look?

- **Inspiration for self-learners**: See what a novice mindset looks like in Zig, learn what *not* to do.
- **A 'so-bad-itâ€™s-good' codebase**: If youâ€™re curious how not to structure a server.
- **Potential red flags to avoid**: Recognize anti-patterns and bad coding habits firsthand.
